			House Arryn of the Eyrie is one of Great Houses of Westeros, and is the principal noble house in the Vale. Their main seat is the Eyrie, but they have many other holdings, including their winter castle at the Gates of the Moon. Both of these fortifications sit astride the Giant's Lance, the tallest mountain in the Vale, and the Eyrie is considered impregnable. Their sigil is a white moon-and-falcon on a sky-blue field, and their words are "As High as Honor."[1] Their line dates back to the old Andal peoples that invaded Westeros. Usually marrying other Andal nobles, House Arryn to this day has the purest line of Andal nobility.[2]

		<h2>History</h2>

		<p>
			Prior to the arrival of the Andals, the Vale was ruled by the First Men under the Mountain Kings. Ser Artys Arryn slew the last of the Mountain Kings and the Arryns became Kings of Mountain and Vale, according to semi-canon sources some six thousand years ago.[3] They renamed the land the Vale of Arryn, and their kings wore the Falcon Crown. The House submitted to House Targaryen when Aegon the Conqueror's sister Visenya arrived at the Eyrie and found that the young king Ronnel wanted to ride a dragon. Since then, the Arryns remained Defenders of the Vale and were also named Wardens of the East, a title that they have always held since.[4]

		<p>
			The Targaryen civil war, the Dance of the Dragons, was a contest of claims between Viserys I's issue from an Arryn wife and a Hightower. Decades later, during the Blackfyre Rebellion, the House remained loyal to King Daeron II. At the climactic Battle of the Redgrass Field Lord Arryn's van was smashed by Daemon Blackfyre.

			The descendents of Lord Jasper Arryn have experienced a variety of calamities that have left the House with very few trueborn members. Jasper's successor, Lord Jon Arryn, married several times to try to sire heirs. His first wife Jeyne Royce died in childbirth, their daughter stillborn. His second wife Rowena Arryn, a cousin, died childless of a winter chill. His sister Alys birthed nine children by her husband Ser Elys Waynwood, dying soon after the last one. All nine died or took religious orders before they could reproduce. Jon and Alys's younger brother Ronnel died of a bad belly many years before the novels.
		</p>
		<p>
			The war that became Robert's Rebellion started when Jon Arryn refused to surrender his wards Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark to the Mad King. The battle against Lord Randyll Grafton at Gulltown saw Lord Arryn defeat his royalist bannermen. During the war, Jon was one of the principal leaders and his marriage to his third wife Lysa Tully helped secure Lord Hoster as an ally. Unfortunately, casualties mounted among the few remaining Arryns. Jon's nephew and heir Elbert Arryn had been part of Brandon Stark's doomed party that went to King's Landing, and his distant cousin Ser Denys, the "darling of the Vale", was killed at the Battle of the Bells. After the war, Nestor Royce ruled as High Steward of the Vale as Jon became Robert's Hand of the King. Lord Jon served loyally for fourteen years before being murdered by poison.

		<h2>Recent Events</h2>

	<p>
		Jon's marriage to Lady Lysa remains a distant one. At first the union had first produced only miscarriages, but finally she gave him a son, Robert, the last Arryn. Robert has been spoiled by Lysa despite the efforts of Lord Jon, and she makes no effort to teach him the ways of lordship. Jon is approached by Stannis Baratheon, who suspects that his brother King Robert has no trueborn heirs, and that Queen Cersei has cuckolded him with her own brother. The two investigate, but Jon is poisoned and dies before they can reveal their revelation.
